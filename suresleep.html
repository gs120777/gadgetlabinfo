                <p>I suddenly woke up from my daughter’s screaming.</p>
                <p>As I shook my head to gain focus, I caught a glimpse of her nine-year-old terrified face in the rearview mirror.</p>
                <p>Only to realize I was heading in full speed into the back of a truck in front of me.</p>
                <p>I had nodded off at the wheel, exhausted from another night of not getting an ounce of sleep.</p>
                <h1>It Almost Took The Life Of My Daughter To Get Serious About Facing My Insomnia.</h1>
                <p>Not getting enough sleep can throw your whole day out of whack.</p>
                <p>Like you, I tossed and turned for hours on end every night and just couldn’t "shut off" my mind to fall asleep.</p>
                <p>I'd just lay in bed forcing my eyes closed and feeling like my heart is about to jump out of my chest from anxiety.</p>
                <p>I couldn't stop worrying about my wife (who is a nurse), the health of my aging parents, the security of my job and the well-being of my daughter...</p>
                <p>After a while, even sleeping meds stop doing jack squat for you.</p>
                <p>So you've either got to riskily up the dose (only to wake up half an hour later and your mind starts going wild again)... or end up overdosing like Elvis.</p>
                <p>It's a vicious cycle of stress, anxiety, sleepless nights and weary mornings...</p>

                <p>But what if I told you there was a groundbreaking new device that naturally "switches off" your mind and puts you asleep in minutes?</p>
                <p>I’m sure the pharmaceutical industry just prays you’ll never discover this little-known gadget I'm about to show you now...</p>
                <h1><u>The Fact Of The Matter Is That Medical Science Does Not Yet Provide Pills For The Brain</u></h1>
                <p>It's no surprise that the REAL cause of insomnia occurs in your brain.</p>
                <p>When you’re awake your mind is alert. Your brain operates on what’s called <strong>beta waves.</strong></p>
                <p>When you're asleep, your mind is "turned off" and your muscles are also relaxed (even paralyzed).</p>
                <p>Your brain then operates on <strong>slow theta waves.</strong> When you reach the deepest, most restful sleep, it operates from even <strong>slower delta waves...</strong></p>
                <figure class="fig3"></figure>
                <h1 class="smh1a">Which Leads Us To A Common-Sense Conclusion:</h1>
                <p>If you could simply <strong>adjust your brainwave activity to slow theta and delta waves...</strong></p>
                <p>Then your mind will <strong>naturally "shut off".</strong></p>
                <p>And your brain will <strong>unconsciously hit "sleep-mode"</strong> without you even trying!</p>
                <p>But how can you do that?</p>
                <h1>Introducing <a href=" https://www.fasttrack12.com/M6DLDZ7D/23ZCT8CB/?uid=11420&source_id=tt&sub1=suresleeplisticle" target="_blank" class="links">Sure Sleep Mask</a>...</h1>
                <figure class="prod"></figure>
                <p>One day a Swedish friend of mine recommended I try this weird new gadget, called <a href=" https://www.fasttrack12.com/M6DLDZ7D/23ZCT8CB/?uid=11420&source_id=tt&sub1=suresleeplisticle" target="_blank" class="links">Sure Sleep Mask</a>.</p>
                <p>It's developed by Swedish sleep experts and scientists to "trick" your mind into falling asleep quickly and easily by triggering your brain to move closer to the theta and delta wave function.</p>
                <p>I was a bit skeptical to try it at first but he assured me it was completely safe and natural. </p>
                <p>And apparently, more than <b>43,590 people in Sweden are using it every night</b> to fall asleep.</p>
                <p>He got me in touch with Göran Kecklund, Ph.D, accredited sleep specialist and director of the Swedish Traffic Medical Association, to explain to me exactly how this device works.</p>
                <h1>How Does It Work?</h1>
                <p><i>"Sure Sleep Mask combines 3 scientifically-proven and lab-tested methods (plus a 4th "hidden" one) to put your brain in a trance-like relaxation. Thus helping you fall asleep much faster, while maximizing your REM and deep sleep quality no matter how severe your insomnia may be."</i></p>
                <p><i>These clinically-proven relaxation techniques for sounder sleep are backed up by hundreds of individuals, independent scientific studies from some of the most respected institutions in the world like:</i></p>
                <figure class="inst"></figure>
                <p class="tcenter"><a href="#research"><u>View research</u></a> ></p>
                <p>So what are these so powerful mechanisms?</p>
                <h1 class="tleft">1) Binaural Frequency "Mind Syncing"</h1>
                <p>First off, <a href=" https://www.fasttrack12.com/M6DLDZ7D/23ZCT8CB/?uid=11420&source_id=tt&sub1=suresleeplisticle" class="links" target="_blank">Sure Sleep Mask</a> can play you Binaural Beats to slow down your brain wave activity.</p>
                <p>Binaural beats have been studied for close to 200 hundred years. And researchers have found that these binaural frequencies can lead your brain from the over alert and awake stage of insomnia (alpha and beta waves)... to a sound deep delta-wave
                    sleep.<sup>2</sup></p>
                <p>Not only that but they're also proven to ease your stress and calm your anxiety.<br/>Thus sending you asleep in record time and keeping you asleep deeper.<sup>3,4,5,6,7,8</sup></p>
                <p>And most importantly? Wake up in the morning feeling refreshed, energized, fully rested and ready to take on the day.</p>
                <p>Even astronauts at NASA are using them to nap in space!<sup>9</sup></p>
                <p>In other words, listening to binaural beats at night can put your brain in total sleep "knockout."</p>
                <figure class="fig4"></figure>
                <h1>But There's A Catch!</h1>
                <p>The effect of binaural beats can only be heard using headphones.</p>
                <p>That's because this phenomenon is a result of playing 2 slightly different tones in each ear.</p>
                <p>Luckily for you, <a href=" https://www.fasttrack12.com/M6DLDZ7D/23ZCT8CB/?uid=11420&source_id=tt&sub1=suresleeplisticle" class="links" target="_blank">Sure Sleep Mask</a> has ultra-slim Bluetooth speakers, so you can comfortably listen to anything you want (even while sleeping on your sides).</p>
                <p>If you're not a fan of binaural beats, you can also choose from other helpful scientific audio options mentioned on <a href=" https://www.fasttrack12.com/M6DLDZ7D/23ZCT8CB/?uid=11420&source_id=tt&sub1=suresleeplisticle" target="_blank" class="links">their company's website such as:</a></p>

                <p>Not only that, but the sound of what you're listening to will also <strong>drown out the unwanted noises</strong> keeping you up. </p>
                <p>And unlike with painful and uncomfortable earbuds, you won't be cutting off circulation, which can lead to permanent necrosis and irreversible hearing loss!<sup>10</sup></p>

                <p>Did you know that even just a pinprick of light at night (whether it be from your electronics or outside)... can sabotage your sleep more than drinking caffeine before bed?</p>
                <p>Yes, that's true. Even the tiniest amount of intrusive light at night can <strong>cut your melatonin levels (the sleep hormone) by more than 50%!?</strong><sup>11</sup></p>
                <p>Meaning even if you got a full 8 hours of sleep, you'll still wake up feeling tired and groggy the next day...</p>
                <p>That's because <strong>evolution has hard-wired our brains</strong> to sleep only when it's dark. </p>
                <p>So <a href=" https://www.fasttrack12.com/M6DLDZ7D/23ZCT8CB/?uid=11420&source_id=tt&sub1=suresleeplisticle" class="links" target="_blank">Sure Sleep Mask</a> blocks out all light. This state of <strong>pure darkness triggers your brain to produce more melatonin naturally.</strong></p>
                <p>Therefore this <b>key sleep hormone</b> does two things for you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span><strong>signals your body to fall asleep</strong> and</span></li>
                    <li><span><strong>boosts your REM & ensures quality deep sleep</strong> for <strong>more restorative nights!</strong></span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>But that’s not all...</p>
