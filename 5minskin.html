                            <p>The year has been rough on everyone, I know. But since this is my story, I hope you don’t mind if I focus on myself for a second. Being single and living alone during this past year was really tough. I’m actually a really sociable
                                person, and my friends and I loved going to the clubs (when we still could), having fun nights out, and getting messy!</p>

                            <p><strong>But then COVID happened</strong>, and like so many, these nights stopped happening altogether. <strong>I found myself home alone and bored out of my mind.</strong></p>

                            <p>So a few weeks ago, <strong>“in-between waves”</strong> as we’ve come to know it now, my friends and I decided to organize a day at the spa. Something to cheer us all up, and a way to get together once again, hang out, <strong>and get some pampering done.</strong></p>

                            <p>We were lounging by the pool, laughing like we hadn’t done in years, when my friend Shelly looked at my legs and exclaimed, </p>

                            <p>“Girl, <strong>WHAT is with your leg hairs!?</strong> Do we need to add a wax to the treatments for today?”</p>

                            <p>I quickly hid my legs underneath the towel and laughed it off. But to be honest, I was <strong>totally embarrassed!</strong> </p>

                            <p>Shelly didn’t mean to be offensive I know, but she didn’t know <strong>the whole story behind my hairy legs.</strong> </p>

                            <p>You see <strong>I have REALLY hairy legs</strong>. I know what you’re thinking, “Duh, everyone has really hairy legs…” But I do, and they drive me crazy. Maybe it’s because I <strong>started shaving at a really young age,</strong>                                and when I shave, it takes about two seconds for the hairs to grow back, and when they do, <strong>they’re thicker than ever.</strong></p>

                            <p><strong>So I started waxing.</strong> I wanted to see if this would help at all. But the WAITING in between each appointment was <strong>almost as painful as the experience itself.</strong> Not to mention <strong>the insane cost!</strong>                                I mean, I would go broke just trying to keep smooth! And then when lockdown started, I stopped going for those anyway, and <strong>I tried home waxing!</strong> Now if I thought a professional wax was painful, this was
                                another level. Plus, with home waxing, you have to wait for your hairs to get a certain length anyway, which is why, when I was with the girls, my legs looked the way they did. I had even tried to save up for <strong>laser hair removal</strong>                                – but the cost of THAT is just astronomical.</p>

                            <p>So there I was. Super self-conscious and wondering which hole would be big enough for me to crawl into, when my other friend Tara pulled me aside.</p>

                            <p>“Sweetie, never mind Shelly.” She said, kindly. <strong>“But let me ask you, what ARE you using for your leg hair?”</strong></p>

                            <p>I explained my whole saga. And then Tara asked. “So you just wait in between home waxes, and then <strong>scream with pain each time?”</strong></p>

                            <p>“I know, but,” I hesitated, “I can’t shave anymore, it makes my hairs grow back too thick, and I can’t afford to go to a professional every 3 weeks either!”</p>

                            <p>Tara raised an eyebrow at me. “So you just plan on having hairy legs then?”</p>

                            <p>I blushed with embarrassment. “Well, no…”</p>

                            <p><i>“She took a sip of her cocktail and said, “Exactly. Now, I’m gonna tell you about this product I’ve been using and it is, literally, going to change your life.” She licked her straw and said, “It’s called <a href="https://5minskin.com/products/5minskin-at-home-laser-hair-removal-handset-np1-1?exc_tid=&&oid=743&affid=185356&source_id=tt&sub1=listicle" target="_blank" style="color: blue;"><strong>5MinSkin </strong></a>. You can only get it from this special website, but I’ve used it for a few months now, and it <strong>works like a charm</strong>. Forget paying hundreds of dollars on home waxes, or a beautician…Buy one of these and it’ll fix the problem. I promise, it’s incredible, and if you try it, you’ll thank me later.”</i></p>

                            <p>We finished up at the spa, and had the best day ever, but the minute I got home I went online to find out more about the <a href="https://5minskin.com/products/5minskin-at-home-laser-hair-removal-handset-np1-1?exc_tid=&&oid=743&affid=185356&source_id=tt&sub1=listicle"
                                    target="_blank" style="color: blue;"><strong>5MinSkin  IPL</strong></a>. I was totally intrigued. I looked it up on the company website, and to my amazement, <strong>it was better than what Tara had told me about.</strong>                                </p>

                            <h2><strong>But…Is It Really Worth All This Hype?</strong></h2>

                            <p>So far, 5MinSkin  IPL has sold over <strong>2 million units</strong> directly to consumers, even without the help of being sold in stores. <a href="https://5minskin.com/products/5minskin-at-home-laser-hair-removal-handset-np1-1?exc_tid=&&oid=743&affid=185356&source_id=tt&sub1=listicle"
                                    target="_blank" style="color: blue;"><strong>5MinSkin </strong></a> has been SELLING OUT every time new stock becomes available, it’s become THAT popular.</p>

                            <p>And, it’s all from word of mouth. People just like you are loving it so much that they’re posting about it on Facebook and telling everyone they know about it.</p>

                            <h2><strong>5MinSkin  IPL has started to develop a cult following, and with over 9,000 5-star reviews, it makes sense. Here’s what customers are saying about it:</strong></h2>

                                <p>My husband got this for me after my leg hair reached an unruly length. I typically like to wax or epilate but during the winter I tend to let it go. I must say I am impressed with this product. I have sensitive skin keeping
                                    me from shaving due to razor burn... this really is a great alternative. It leaves a nice smooth finish. It’s nice and compact. I love that you can take it anywhere with you on the go. And even with my sensitive skin,
                                    I’ve experienced no redness or burning whatsoever. </p>

                                    and used it on the go. It works so great I want to get another to keep one at home & one in my purse. </p>

                            <p>It turns out they were running a 50% discount, with a fast shipping sale.</p>

                            <p><strong>…Here’s What I Found.</strong></p>

                            <p>It arrived in just a few days, much faster than I thought it would. Right out of the box I knew <strong>this was a good investment.</strong> Honestly, I didn’t expect it to be such a <strong>high quality considering the price</strong>                                —and that’s how I knew I’d really hit the jackpot. I decided to test it out right away.</p>

                            <p>The first thing I noticed was how <strong>easily and comfortably it fitted in my hand.</strong> I gently pressed the head of the unit flat against my skin. I then proceeded to remove the unwanted hair. </p>

                            <p>The next thing I noticed was how <strong>painless</strong> it was! I could feel a slight zap, but compared to what I was used to, this was nothing! When I was done I looked at my legs and honestly was in shock. </p>

                            <p>Now I know how it got its name! My legs were silky smooth! I felt like I had found the holy grail. I tried it out after the shower, and it worked just as well. <strong>This was a real life-changer.</strong></p>

                            <p>I finally had the solution for my leg hair! I got back on the company’s official website and bought two more <strong>5MinSkin ’s as gifts for my sister and mother.</strong> And they were offering a special deal for two of them
                                anyway!</p>

                            <p>Once I’d seen how amazing this thing was, I knew that they would all find a use for it. Thanks to 5MinSkin , hairiness is no longer an issue. </p>

                            <p>I only wish I had discovered <a href="https://5minskin.com/products/5minskin-at-home-laser-hair-removal-handset-np1-1?exc_tid=&&oid=743&affid=185356&source_id=tt&sub1=listicle" target="_blank"
                                    style="color: blue;"><strong>5MinSkin </strong></a> earlier! Turns out Tara was right. </p>

                            <h2><strong>Is It Worth It?</strong></h2>

                            <p>Of course! I look at my 5MinSkin  as <strong>an incredible purchase</strong>. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen things that look useful, I buy them, and they just collect dust on a shelf until our next garage sale.
                                That is not the case with 5MinSkin ! I get so much use out of it. And I’ve <strong>saved thousands of dollars</strong> because I don’t need home wax kits, professional appointments, or even – laser! I just needed the <strong>right product for the job</strong>.
                                I needed the 5MinSkin .</p>

                            <p>This is a high-quality product, and people are starting to catch on about it. But here’s the thing: they are designed in relatively small batches. So stock is limited. If you want to get one, you should act now because they
                                sell out almost as quickly as they become available. </p>
